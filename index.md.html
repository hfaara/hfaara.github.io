# Title: Generating Art from a Neural Network

Project description
==============================================================
When I was learning to create web-based computer games, I came across a field of programming where coders created all
sorts of very visually appealing art through the use of mathematical formulas, loops, etc. This led me to appreciate
the formulaic nature of what we find appealing to the senses, and how different forms of art can be generated with code.
This along with news of OpenAI's DALL-E neural network's ability to generate impressive images when given text descriptions as an
input led me to consider training a neural network with images of computational art towards training a neural network
that generates new art that will hopefully be appealing to look at.

The project will be deployed as an application where users will be allowed to generate new artwork from specific
computational artists by selecting a few checkboxes and clicking on a button.

If all goes well, I'll try to train the model with images of more traditional artpieces to find whether that too
could be used as an input for a successful art generator. This would allow me to examine if more traditional artpieces
have a formulaic side to them, and if similar ones could be recreated by the model.


*Project goals*:
1. Create a dataset with 1k+ computational art images.
2. Explore way to train a neural netowork model that generates images.
3. Train a neural network that successfully generates art from an input of computational art images.
